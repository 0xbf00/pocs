`xpc_create_from_plist` is used by `libsystem_secinit.dylib` to parse and decode
entitlements of an app. The job of this library is to initialise the App Sandbox
if the app possesses certain entitlements.

The problem is that `xpc_create_from_plist` does not handle all valid plist encodings,
despite other sandboxing components treating such entitlements as valid. Back in
2018, the function was unable to parse UTF8-encoded entitlements if they began
with a BOM. Apple patched this particular shortcoming in macOS 10.13.5 and above
(CVE-2018-4229).

Similar issues still exist. For example, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoded entitlements
cannot be parsed currently. Rather than killing the app, the error is silently
ignored and apps are started unsandboxed.
